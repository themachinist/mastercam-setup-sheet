# MasterCAM Setup Sheet
A sample ActiveReports setup sheet for MasterCAM.

I've recently found that some people sell ActiveReports templates. 

That's insane. You can have this one for free.

1) you may <b>not</b> sell this template or <i>any work derived</i> from it<br>
2) you must use the same license if you choose to release a derived work
